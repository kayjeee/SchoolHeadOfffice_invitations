Overview of File Updates
Files Affected by the Changes
1. SettingsLayout.js (Primary Changes)
Purpose: Central component that fetches grades and distributes them to child components

Key Updates:

Added comprehensive debugging throughout the component

Fixed school ID handling to support both id and _id properties

Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages

Added visual debug UI showing school ID, grades count, and active tab

Improved API response handling to handle different response structures

Added request timeout to prevent hanging requests

Fixed dependency array in useEffect to properly track schoolId changes

2. GradesContainer.js (Major Refactor)
Purpose: Displays and manages grades, now receives grades as props instead of fetching independently

Key Updates:

Removed duplicate API fetching logic - now relies on parent component for data

Added grades prop with proper synchronization via useEffect

Updated CRUD operations to show alerts instead of trying to refresh locally

Removed loading/error states related to grade fetching (handled by parent)

Fixed InvitationComposer integration to properly pass grades prop

Maintained all UI functionality while simplifying data flow

3. InvitationComposer.js (Enhanced)
Purpose: Composes and sends invitations, now properly receives grades from parent

Key Updates:

Enhanced prop handling with better debugging and validation

Added comprehensive logging to track prop changes

Improved error states for missing data scenarios

Better UI feedback when grades or schools are not available

Maintained all invitation functionality while fixing data flow issues

Data Flow Architecture Changes
Before (Problematic):
text
SettingsLayout → [fetches grades?] → GradesContainer → [fetches grades again?]
SettingsLayout → InvitationManagementTabs → InvitationComposer [empty grades]
After (Fixed):
text
SettingsLayout → [fetches grades once] → GradesContainer [receives grades as props]
SettingsLayout → [fetches grades once] → InvitationManagementTabs → InvitationComposer [receives grades]
Key Benefits of These Changes
Single Source of Truth: Grades are fetched only once by SettingsLayout

Consistent Data: All child components receive the same grades data

Reduced API Calls: Eliminated duplicate grade fetching requests

Better Performance: Fewer network requests and state updates

Improved Debugging: Comprehensive logging throughout the data flow

Maintained Functionality: All existing features preserved while fixing architecture

Debugging Enhancements Added
Console logging at every major data flow point

Visual debug UI showing current state values

Error boundary handling with retry mechanisms

Prop validation and structure checking

API call tracing with URL and response logging

Files That Remain Unchanged
Sidebar.js - Navigation remains the same

Modal components (CreateGradeModal, EditGradeModal, DeleteGradeModal) - Functionality preserved

Learner management components (LearnersTable, LearnersFilters, BulkUpload, LearnerDetail) - No changes needed

Invitation components (TemplateManager, StatusTracker, CreditSystem) - Already working correctly

Expected Behavior After Changes
SettingsLayout fetches grades when a school is selected

GradesContainer receives grades as props and displays them

InvitationComposer receives the same grades data and can send invitations

All CRUD operations work but show alerts suggesting manual refresh (parent should handle refresh)

Debug information is visible in both console and UI for troubleshooting

The changes create a clean, single-direction data flow that resolves the issue of empty grades in the InvitationComposer while maintaining all existing functionality.
