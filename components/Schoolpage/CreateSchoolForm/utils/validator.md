Step 2: Create validators.js
Next, let's create a utility file for validation. This will keep our validation rules clean and separate from the form's logic.

Create a new file at components/schoolpage/CreateSchoolForm/utils/validators.js.

Move the validation logic from handleNextStep into separate, reusable functions.

Export these functions.
